## Figure 1: Overview of the DNS Resolution and Registration Processes

This figure illustrates the two core functions of DNS:

1. **DNS Resolution**: The process of converting domain names into IP addresses, allowing users to access websites and services.
   - Users send a query for a domain name (e.g., example.com).
   - The DNS resolver communicates with root servers, TLD servers, and authoritative name servers to retrieve the correct IP address.
   - Once the IP address is found, it is cached by the resolver and returned to the user's browser.

2. **DNS Registration**: The process by which domain names are registered through a **domain registrar**.
   - Registrants select and register domain names with accredited registrars.
   - The registrar records the domain in the corresponding **TLD registry** and ensures that the domain points to the correct authoritative name server.

These processes ensure that domain names are both **resolvable** (users can access them) and **registered** (domains are mapped to IPs and servers).

## Figure 2: The Hierarchical Structure of the DNS Name Space

This figure shows the **hierarchical structure** of DNS, which is a tree-like organization:

- At the top is the **root zone**, which is managed by **root servers**. The root zone points to all **Top-Level Domains (TLDs)**.
- **TLDs** include familiar domains like **.com**, **.org**, and **country-code TLDs (ccTLDs)** like **.uk** or **.jp**.
- Below TLDs are **second-level domains** (e.g., example.com), and further subdivisions can occur through **subdomains** (e.g., sub.example.com).
  
The hierarchical nature ensures that domain name management is decentralized, yet still globally organized, ensuring redundancy and reliability.

## Figure 3: Overview of Potential Incidents Affecting DNS Security

This figure highlights the **potential security incidents** that can affect DNS:

1. **DNS Spoofing/Cache Poisoning**: Attackers inject fake DNS responses into the resolver's cache, redirecting users to malicious sites.
2. **DNS Hijacking**: Attackers take over the DNS registration process to redirect domain traffic to unauthorized servers, affecting user privacy and data integrity.
3. **DDoS Attacks on DNS Servers**: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks overwhelm DNS servers with traffic, rendering domain resolution unavailable.
4. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (MITM)**: Attackers intercept DNS traffic, allowing them to monitor or modify communication between users and websites.

These incidents compromise the **availability**, **confidentiality**, and **integrity** of the DNS system, making DNS security a priority for Internet stakeholders.

## Figure 4: Effects of DNS Hijacking

DNS hijacking can have serious effects:

- **Redirection to Malicious Sites**: Users trying to access legitimate websites are redirected to malicious ones, leading to **phishing attacks**, **malware downloads**, or data theft.
- **Service Downtime**: DNS hijacking can disrupt normal business operations, causing significant **downtime** and financial losses.
- **Loss of Trust**: Compromised domains can damage an organization's reputation, leading to a loss of customer trust.

This figure emphasizes the importance of securing the DNS registration process and ensuring that **registrars** and **TLD operators** implement robust security measures.

## Figure 5: Overview of Existing Efforts and Emerging Solutions to Enhance DNS Security

This figure summarizes ongoing efforts and emerging solutions for **improving DNS security**:

1. **DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)**: DNSSEC provides cryptographic signatures to ensure the integrity of DNS responses, preventing cache poisoning.
2. **DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) and DNS-over-TLS (DoT)**: These protocols encrypt DNS queries, preventing attackers from intercepting or tampering with DNS traffic.
3. **Registry Lock**: This feature prevents unauthorized changes to domain records by adding an extra layer of security for critical domain names.
4. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Many registrars now require 2FA for managing domain records, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

Despite these efforts, challenges remain, particularly in terms of **adoption rates** and the **technical complexity** of implementing security measures like DNSSEC.

## Figure 6: DNSSEC Deployment Requires Both Validation and Signing

This figure illustrates the deployment model for **DNSSEC**, showing that it requires both **DNS resolvers** to validate cryptographic signatures and **domain registrants** to sign their DNS records:

1. **Signing**: Domain owners must digitally sign their DNS records using **private keys**. These signatures are stored in DNS records and ensure that responses are authentic.
2. **Validation**: DNS resolvers must validate these signatures using **public keys** to confirm that the DNS records have not been tampered with.

Without both signing and validation, the integrity of DNS records cannot be guaranteed, and the system remains vulnerable to attacks like cache poisoning.

## Figure 7: The Key Role of Economic Incentives to Increase DNSSEC Adoption

This figure highlights the **economic challenges** of DNSSEC adoption, particularly for smaller organizations or developing countries:

- **Cost of Implementation**: DNSSEC requires investment in infrastructure, training, and ongoing maintenance. Smaller **ccTLD operators** or **local ISPs** may lack the financial resources to implement DNSSEC effectively.
- **Incentives for Adoption**: Policymakers and Internet stakeholders need to create **economic incentives** to encourage wider adoption of DNSSEC. This could include subsidies, regulatory frameworks, or partnerships to lower the cost and complexity of DNSSEC deployment.

The figure stresses that economic barriers are a key reason for the slow global adoption of DNSSEC, even though it is essential for improving DNS security.

## Conclusion

These figures collectively provide a detailed visual representation of how the DNS operates, the risks it faces, and the solutions being implemented to mitigate security threats. They highlight the importance of DNSSEC, encrypted DNS transport, and economic incentives in ensuring a secure and resilient DNS ecosystem.
